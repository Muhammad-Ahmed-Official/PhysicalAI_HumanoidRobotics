# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robots

Welcome to Module 4 of the AI/Humanoid Robotics Book. This module focuses on implementing natural language understanding and autonomous task execution in simulation environments, culminating in a capstone project.

## Overview

This module will teach you how to implement natural language understanding and processing for robot command interpretation, along with multi-modal perception integration. You'll learn about:

- Natural language understanding for robot commands
- Action planning from language commands
- Multi-modal perception integration
- Autonomous task execution in simulation
- A capstone project demonstrating voice-driven humanoid tasks

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement natural language understanding for robots
- Plan actions from language commands
- Integrate multi-modal perception systems
- Execute autonomous tasks in simulation environments
- Complete a comprehensive capstone project with voice-driven humanoid tasks

## Chapters

This module contains the following chapters:

1. [Natural Language Understanding for Robots](./chapter-4-1.md)
2. [Action Planning from Language Commands](./chapter-4-2.md)
3. [Multi-Modal Perception Integration](./chapter-4-3.md)
4. [Autonomous Task Execution in Simulation](./chapter-4-4.md)
5. [Capstone Project: Voice-Driven Humanoid Task](./chapter-4-5.md)

## Prerequisites
