# AI/Spec-Driven Book Using Docusaurus Constitution

## Core Principles

### Clear, beginner-friendly technical writing
Content must be written in an accessible way that allows beginners to understand complex concepts easily; explanations should be clear and jargon-free when possible, with definitions provided when technical terms are necessary. This ensures our documentation is inclusive and valuable to the widest possible audience.

### Accuracy using official documentation only
All content must be based on verified and official sources; no speculative or unofficial information should be included; references to official documentation are mandatory. This maintains trustworthiness and reliability of our educational materials.

### Reproducible steps and validated code examples
All instructions and code examples must be tested to ensure they work as described; readers should be able to follow along and reproduce results exactly as presented. This creates a reliable learning experience and builds confidence in our guidance.

### Consistent structure across all chapters
Chapters must follow a standardized format of Summary → Objectives → Explanation → Example → Checklist to provide predictability and ease of navigation for readers. This consistent approach facilitates learning and makes the content more accessible.

### Engaging and eye-catching UI/UX
Docusaurus implementation must incorporate visually appealing themes, readable typography, proper color contrast, responsive spacing, and interactive elements to enhance the learning experience. The user interface should support and enhance the educational content, not distract from it.

### Zero Plagiarism and Original Content Generation
All content must be original and created from scratch based on specifications; no copying from existing sources is allowed; all content must be generated specifically for this project. This ensures authenticity and compliance with copyright requirements.

## Standards and Technical Requirements
All instructions must be testable and reproducible; Code must run in Node.js + Docusaurus v3+; Content written in Markdown/MDX for Docusaurus; UI/UX enhancements must include Docusaurus theme customization, code highlighting, images/diagrams, and mobile responsiveness. These standards ensure technical consistency and quality across the project.

## Content Structure and Organization
Book must include specific chapters: Introduction, Setup Guide, Book Creation Workflow, AI-Assisted Writing, Deployment to GitHub Pages, and Troubleshooting Guide; Each chapter follows a standardized structure. This provides comprehensive coverage of the topic with predictable organization for learners.

## Governance
Constitution defines mandatory practices for all contributors; All changes must comply with these principles; Amendments require documented review and approval process; This constitution supersedes any conflicting practices. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles and requirements.
