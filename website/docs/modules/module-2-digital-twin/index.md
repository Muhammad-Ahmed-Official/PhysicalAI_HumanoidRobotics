# Module 2: Digital Twin - Simulation Environments

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI/Humanoid Robotics Book. This module focuses on creating realistic simulation environments using tools like Gazebo and Unity to test robot behaviors before deploying to physical hardware.

## Overview

This module will teach you how to create digital twins of robotic systems by setting up 3D environments with accurate physics and sensor simulation. You'll learn to:

- Set up 3D simulation environments with realistic physics
- Use Gazebo for robotics simulation
- Use Unity for more advanced simulation scenarios
- Import robot models and control them in simulation
- Visualize scenarios and test different conditions

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up complete simulation environments with realistic physics
- Configure and use Gazebo for robotic simulation
- Use Unity for creating advanced simulation environments
- Import robot models and implement controls
- Conduct scenario testing in simulation environments

## Chapters

This module contains the following chapters:

1. [Introduction to Digital Twins](./chapter-2-1.md)
2. [3D Simulation Environment Setup](./chapter-2-2.md)
3. [Physics and Sensor Simulation](./chapter-2-3.md)
4. [Robot Model Import and Control](./chapter-2-4.md)
5. [Visualization and Scenario Testing](./chapter-2-5.md)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of 3D concepts
- Familiarity with simulation tools (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with the [first chapter](./chapter-2-1.md) to learn about digital twins and their role in robotics development.
