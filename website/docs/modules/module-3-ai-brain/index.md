# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain - Perception and Planning

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI/Humanoid Robotics Book. This module focuses on integrating AI systems for robot perception and decision-making, bridging the gap between pure AI research and embodied robotics.

## Overview

This module will teach you how to apply machine learning models to robot perception and integrate AI systems that can interpret sensor data with robot control systems. You'll learn about:

- AI perception modules for vision and audio processing
- Motion planning and decision-making algorithms
- Integration of AI models with robot controllers
- Simulation-to-real bridging techniques
- Testing intelligent behaviors in robotic systems

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Implement AI perception modules for vision and audio processing
- Design motion planning and decision-making systems
- Integrate AI models with robot control systems
- Apply simulation-to-real bridging techniques
- Test and validate intelligent behaviors in robots
