# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI/Humanoid Robotics Book. This module focuses on understanding the fundamentals of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems.

## Overview

This module will introduce you to the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture, which is essential for developing humanoid robots. You'll learn about:

- The fundamental architecture of ROS 2
- How nodes communicate with each other
- Design patterns used in robotics middleware
- How to simulate sensors and actuators
- Debugging and logging tools for ROS 2 systems

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core architecture of ROS 2
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes
- Understand different communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Apply middleware design patterns to robotic systems
- Use debugging and logging tools effectively in ROS 2

## Chapters

This module contains the following chapters:

1. [ROS 2 Architecture and Nodes](./ch-001-architecture-nodes.md)
2. [Topics, Services, and Messages](./ch-002-topics-services-messages.md)
3. [Middleware Design Patterns](./ch-003-middleware-design-patterns.md)
4. [Sensor and Actuator Simulation](./ch-004-sensor-actuator-simulation.md)
5. [Debugging and Logging Tools](./ch-005-debugging-logging-tools.md)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Understanding of general software architecture concepts

## Getting Started

Begin with the [first chapter](./ch-001-architecture-nodes.md) to dive into the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture and nodes.
