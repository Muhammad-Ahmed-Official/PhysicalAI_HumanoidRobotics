# Accessibility Statement

We are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users. This website follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards to ensure that all learners, regardless of their abilities, can access and benefit from our educational content.

## Our Commitment

Our goal is to provide an accessible learning experience that accommodates users with various needs, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other specialized tools.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1

We adhere to the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, which are organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable
- All content is available to users regardless of sensory ability
- Alternative text is provided for all images and diagrams
- Content is presented in multiple formats when possible
- Sufficient contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1 for normal text) are maintained

### 2. Operable
- The user interface is navigable through multiple input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- Users have adequate time to read and use content
- Content is not designed in a way that causes seizures
- Navigation is predictable and consistent

### 3. Understandable
- Information and UI operation are understandable
- Instructions are clear and concise
- Error prevention and correction mechanisms are in place

### 4. Robust
- Content is robust enough to work with various assistive technologies
- Code follows proper semantic structure (HTML5 elements, ARIA attributes)

## Specific Measures

- **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG contrast requirements with high contrast themes available
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
- **Alternative Text**: All images include descriptive alt text
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading structure (H1 → H6) and semantic elements
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Content is structured to work with screen readers

## Ongoing Efforts

We continuously work to improve accessibility across all content. This includes:
- Regular testing with accessibility tools
- User feedback incorporation
- Training for content creators on accessibility best practices
- Regular updates to ensure compliance with evolving standards
